Instructions: Write a polite and professional message based on the message type specified. If this is a reply, acknowledge their previous message appropriately. If this is an initial message, craft an appropriate opening. Be concise but warm. Use emojis sparingly when appropriate to convey a friendly tone. Use the key points provided to craft the main content of your message - these may be rough notes, ideas, or specific information that should be included in a polished, professional manner.

When you reference technical details, code, logs, dashboards, screenshots, or other supporting materials in your key points, leave appropriate space in the message for links, images, or attachments. Use phrases like "Here's the error I'm seeing:" or "I've attached a screenshot showing:" or "You can see the issue in this dashboard:" followed by a blank line where the supporting material can be inserted.
