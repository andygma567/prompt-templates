Instructions: Create a well-structured PR description with clear sections using markdown formatting and generate an appropriate title. Include placeholders for links, screenshots, and code examples where relevant. Be concise but thorough, helping reviewers understand the changes and context.

Template structure should include:
- Summary/Overview of changes
- What & Why (problem being solved)
- How (approach taken)  
- Testing done
- Screenshots/demos (if applicable)
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Checklist for reviewer
- Placeholders for links to related issues, documentation, or supporting materials

When you reference code changes, specific files, test results, or UI changes in your context, leave appropriate space in the description for code snippets, screenshots, or links using phrases like "Here's the key change:" or "Screenshot of the new feature:" or "Link to related issue:" followed by a blank line where the supporting material can be inserted.
